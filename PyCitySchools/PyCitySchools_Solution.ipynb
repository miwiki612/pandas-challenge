    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "- Charter school is a public school that operates as a school of choice.\n",
    "- District school is a public school under the control of a local/district school board.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the definition, we could notice a Charter school is an additional option and a District school is a fundamental education supplier. How those two types of school are funded is cohesive with the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### District Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, 15 schools and a total 39,170 students are included. Overall, the average score on Math is 78.99, Reading is 81.88. When a score is higher than or equal to 70 as pass, 74.88% of students pass Math, 85.81% of students pass Reading and 65.17% students pass both Math and Reading. In general Math could be more challenging for students and for individual students their performance on Math and Reading could be very different.\n",
    "\n",
    "### School Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Highest-Performing Schools\n",
    "\n",
    "The top 5 schools are schools with 97.04% to 95.95% of students passing both Math and Reading. All of the top schools are Charter schools. Passing rate on Math is about 2.9% less than Reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cabrera High School has the highest overall passing rate, 97.04%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bottom Performing Schools\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottom 5 schools are schools with 53.54% to 52.99% of students passing both Math and Reading. All of the bottom schools are District schools. Passing rate on Math and Reading have large variance, Math is about 14.7% less than Reading. The performance on Math is significantly worse compared to Reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rodriguez High School has the lowest overall passing rate, 52.99%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Math and Reading Scores by Grade\n",
    "\n",
    "Average score has no significant difference between grades for individual schools. Standard deviation on score is less than 1 for both Math and Reading in all grades. However the performance for schools are variance. Average Math score’s standard deviation is 3.40 and Reading score’s standard deviation is 1.57.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare average score and passing rate, it’s obvious to point out the students in better performing schools have generally similar good performance. On the other hand, in a school without ideal performance, students’ performance can be very good or very bad. Therefore schools have similar average scores and yet the passing rate is significantly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scores by School Spending, School Size and School Type\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, schools with lower Spending Ranges (Per Student), less than $585 and smaller size, less than 2000 students have better performance. School has higher Spending Ranges (Per Student) and larger size has less ideal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally,  Spending Ranges (Per Student) and School Size are both correlated to School Type. Charter schools usually have less Spending Ranges (Per Student) and smaller in size. District school is opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Charter schools have better performance than District schools. Since by definition Charter school is an optional school, they won’t exist in the first place if the performance is not significantly better.\n",
