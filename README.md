## pandas-challenge

- Basic
Answers are based on <PyCitySchools_start.ipynb>. All blanks are filled with code to achieve the displayed result.
  
- Additional code
To challenge myself, I tried to find another approach or added some additional code to use in report. All commonned with "# not required in original start".

- Warning notes
Some groupby shows numeric warring, but dataframe shows data type as int64 or float. I used < numeric_only=True > to mutate the warning.
